- Configured persistent subagent dispatch and progress tracking rules

### Key Additions to AGENTS.md
- Added Agent Workflow Rules section with:
  - Subagent dispatch policy (code/edit/feature work only)
  - Skills auto-loading rules
  - Progress.md tracking requirements (chronological, milestone-based)

### Configuration Decisions
- progress.md format: chronological (oldest first)
- Update trigger: end of each task/milestone
- Subagent scope: code, edit, and feature work

## Session: June 7, 2026 (Evening)

### Updates Made
- **Phase 0 — Refactor**: Split monolithic 1548-line `page.js` into tab files + shared components
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/constants.js` (THEME, COLORS, categories, banks, months)
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/helpers.js` (formatRp, parseTxDate, formatShortDate, useCountUp, useCountUpOvershoot, useSoundPref, playSuccessSound)
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/SelectField.jsx` (extracted with aria-labels)
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/CustomTooltip.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/PillButton.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/EmptyState.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/_components/EditTransactionModal.jsx` (new)
  - `src/app/dashboard/HomeTab.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/StatsTab.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/WalletTab.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/ProfileTab.jsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/page.js` (rewritten as orchestrator shell, ~600 lines)

- **Phase 1 — Code fixes** (B1-B6):
  - B1: Added `formatShortDate` helper to fix `date.slice(0,5)` double-digit bug
  - B2: Removed hardcoded mock stats from login page
  - B3: Replaced fake "Premium" account type with "Personal"
  - B4: Moved `themeColor` to viewport export (silences build warnings)
  - B5: Added `aria-label` to ~20 icon-only buttons, `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons
  - B6: Increased bottom padding from `pb-32` to `pb-44` to clear nav

- **Phase 2 — Quick wins** (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q9):
  - Q1: Custom date-range filter with collapsible toggle + active filter chip
  - Q2: Skeleton loaders on Stats tab during refresh
  - Q3: Haptic feedback `navigator.vibrate(50)` on successful add
  - Q4: Animated count-up for drill-down modal "Top 10" total
  - Q5: "Today" ring on calendar heatmap cell
  - Q6: Small TypeIcon badge on insight cards (TrendingUp/AlertCircle/Info)
  - Q9: Left-border color accent on recent transactions

- **Phase 3 — H features** (H6, H8):
  - H6: Year-over-year section placeholder (existing compareMode handles current/previous year) — enhancement deferred to keep scope tight
  - H8: New insight pattern "Spending X% di atas/di bawah rata-rata" (auto-generated when specific month is selected)

- **Phase 4 — Polish** (P4, P7, P8, P9):
  - P4: Animated gradient bar at bottom of header (mesh-aurora + animate-gradient)
  - P7: `useCountUpOvershoot` hook for hero tile (sharper curve + 1.08x bounce)
  - P8: Background parallax on scroll (`translateY(scrollY * -0.15)`)
  - P9: Web Audio API "ka-ching" (880Hz + 1320Hz tones) on success, toggleable in Profile

- **Phase 5 — H2 Edit/Delete transactions**:
  - New `src/app/api/transaction/[id]/route.js` with PUT (update row) and DELETE (clear row) handlers
  - `EditTransactionModal` component with pre-filled form
  - Edit/Delete buttons in drill-down modal (hover to reveal)
  - `rowIndex` field added to all transactions in `/api/dashboard`
  - `confirm()` dialog for delete safety

### Files Changed
- Created: 11 new files (components, tabs, API route)
- Modified: 4 files (page.js, layout.js, page.js login, api/dashboard/route.js)

### Verification
- Build status: pending (about to run)

### Notes
- All changes preserve existing behavior
- Sound effect uses Web Audio API (no audio file needed)
- Edit/Delete strategy: clear row contents in Sheets (leaves empty rows but no API quota issues)
- Refactor: state lives in main `page.js` shell, passed as props to tabs (no Context needed for this size)

### Discovered Global Subagents
- Found 29 additional global subagents in `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
- They were not previously documented in AGENTS.md
- Categories: Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Data, Quality, Domain, Research, Workflow

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued — milestone: expanded subagent list)

### Updates Made
- Expanded subagent guide in AGENTS.md with all 29 global subagents from `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
- Organized subagents into 9 domain categories with descriptions
- Updated source note: dispatch from both `.agents/` and global `~/.config/opencode/agents/`

### Key Details
- 36 total subagents now documented (7 project + 29 global)
- 7 project-level override the global versions with same name
- Global path: `C:\Users\acer\.config\opencode/agents/`

## Session: June 7, 2026 (continued — Vercel hard refresh crash fix)

### Problem
Vercel deployment showed "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" on hard refresh of `/dashboard`. Browser console revealed `Minified React error #310` ("Rendered fewer hooks than expected. This can be caused by an accidental early return statement.").

### Root Cause
During the Phase 0 refactor, hooks (`useMemo` for `filteredTransactions` and `insights`) were left **after** the early returns (`if (status === "loading")` and `if (error)`) in `src/app/dashboard/page.js`. On the first render (loading=true), React called N hooks, then returned the loading spinner. On the second render (data loaded), React called N+2 hooks (the 2 useMemos were now reached). Different hook count → React error #310 → entire tree crashes.

This is the same class of bug mentioned in AGENTS.md "Hooks order fix" — it got re-introduced during the refactor.

### Why local `npm run dev` worked
Dev mode logs a warning but the page still renders. Production minified build crashes hard. The build also never crashed because `next build` only compiles, doesn't execute. The user had to test with `next start` or in the Vercel deployment.

### Fix Applied
- Moved the hooks block (`isAllMonths`, `isAllYears`, `isAllAccounts`, `hasDateRange`, `useMemo filteredTransactions`, `statIncome/statExpense/statSavings/statSurplus`, `useMemo expenseCategories`, `useMemo incomeCategories`, `useMemo insights`) to before the early returns, right after the last `useCallback` (`handleTouchEnd`)
- Removed the duplicate inline computations that were after the early returns
- Wrapped `expenseCategories` and `incomeCategories` in `useMemo` (was inline previously) so the `insights` useMemo dependency array is correct
- Kept non-hook derivations (`clientMonthlyData`, `availableYears`, `availableAccounts`, `getMonthData`, `compareDataA/B`, `compareChartData`, `top5Categories`, `trendData`, `expenseRatio`, `gaugeAngle`, `gaugeColor`, calendar logic, `topCategory`, `recent5`, etc.) at their original positions after the early returns — they only need to run on the "loaded" path

### Verification
- `npm run build` passes cleanly
- Bundle size unchanged: 129 kB → 129 kB
- All 6 routes generate successfully
- The 2 `useMemo`s handle `data === null` gracefully via `(data?.transactions || [])` so the loading render doesn't crash

### Files Changed
- `src/app/dashboard/page.js` — hooks block moved up, duplicate useMemos removed

### Bonus Observations (not fixed)
- `favicon.ico` 404 in console
- `icon-192.png` 404 in console (referenced by `public/manifest.json` but doesn't exist)
- Easy follow-up: add `public/icon-192.png` or remove from manifest
